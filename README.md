These programs will supplement class handouts for Stat 4197/6197 at the George Washington University. Students will find these programs helpful in learning about the concepts and applications of SAS programmning language, SQL, macro facility, and SAS/IML. The sample programs were written by the course instructor or adapted from various sources including SAS Documentation, SAS Blogs, and SAS-L. Please let the instructor know of any errors if you have found. Don't circulate the material.
