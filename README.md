SASCourse - GitHub Organization Account
=======================================

This repository contains sample programs that are used by the instructor to
introduce a wide variety of concepts and applications of SAS programming
language, SQL, macro facility, and SAS/IML to students of Stat 4197/6197 at the
George Washington University. Organized in different folders by topic, the
sample programs will supplement weekly class handouts that are posted to
Blackboard. Students are encouraged to use these programs as practice exercises
to enhance their comprehension of the materials being discussed in class. The
programs were written by the course instructor or adapted from various sources
including SAS® Documentation, SUGI/SGF papers, Blogs, SAS-L, and
SAS Support Communities (communities.sas.com). 
Please let the instructor know of any errors if you have found
