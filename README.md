# SASCourse - GitHub Organization Account
This privtae GitHub repository contains sample SAS programs that are used by the instructor to introduce SAS programming to students of STAT 4197/6197 at George Washington University. These programs center around topics that include key SAS language concepts as well as a wide variety applications of Base SAS (DATA step, SAS procedures, ODS, DATA step debugger, and macro facility), SQL, and SAS/IML. In addition, some applications of the SASPy package using selected features of the Python language in JupyterLab platform are also introduced.

Stored in different weekly folders, the sample programs will supplement weekly class handouts that are posted to GW Blackboard as well as here. Students are encouraged to use these programs as practice exercises to enhance their comprehension of the materials being discussed in class. The programs were written by the course instructor or adapted from various sources including SAS® Documentation, SUGI/SGF papers, Blogs, SAS-L, and SAS Support Communities (communities.sas.com). Please let the instructor know of any errors if you have found in the materials posted here. Don't circulate the materials.

For a high-level overview, topics covered in the course are listed under different sections (1 through 5) below. There are some additional advanced topics, which are included in sections 6 and 7; these topics will not be covered in this course.
