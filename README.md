SASCourse - GitHub Organization Account
=======================================

This repository contains sample programs that are used by the instructor to
introduce SAS programming to students of Stat 4197/6197 at the George Washington
University. The topics include a wide variety of concepts and applications of
Base SAS, SQL, macro facility, and SAS/IML. Some applications of the SASPy
package using selected features of the Python language in a JupyterLab notebook
are also introduced.

Organized in different folders by topic, the sample programs will supplement
weekly class handouts that are posted to Blackboard. Students are encouraged to
use these programs as practice exercises to enhance their comprehension of the
materials being discussed in class. The programs were written by the course
instructor or adapted from various sources including SAS® Documentation,
SUGI/SGF papers, Blogs, SAS-L, and SAS Support Communities
(communities.sas.com). Please let the instructor know of any errors if you have
found in the code snippets posted here. Don't circulate the materials.
