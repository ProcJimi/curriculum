**Course Description:**

This is a one-semester course designed to introduce students to the SAS language
for accessing data; creating and manipulating SAS data values; managing,
combining and summarizing SAS datasets; and generating reports. The course also
covers the SAS macro language, and key aspects of both the Structured Query
Language (SQL) and the Interactive Matrix Language (IML).

**Course Prerequisites:**

This course is intended for students who have taken a course in programming and
intend to develop an appreciation for the inner workings of SAS. Formal
prerequisites for the course are an introductory course in statistics (e.g.,
STAT 1051 or 1053), prior knowledge of programming or permission of the
instructor. Familiarity with SAS is desired but not required; however, students
cannot get credit for both STAT 4197 and STAT 6197.

**Learning Outcomes:**

After completing the course, students will be able to:

-   read raw data and Microsoft Excel files into SAS

-   create new variables using assignment and sum statements, and conditional
    logic

-   manipulate data using SAS functions, SAS arrays, and Do loops, etc.

-   combine, reshape, aggregate and summarize data, and generate reports

-   perform queries and join tables with the SQL procedure

-   automate and customize the generation of SAS code with the macro language

-   write data driven dynamic programs using the macro language

-   manipulate matrices and SAS datasets using PROC IML

-   navigate through important resources for writing and debugging SAS programs

**Assessments:**

For this course, there will be four quizzes/in-class SAS programming
assignments, two homework assignments, and two exams – a total of eight
assessments. There will be an optional additional quiz/in-class programming
assignment, which students can take and drop the lowest score in tests
(excluding assignments, and exams). For each assessment, students’ scores will
be reported in points. To compute their weighted average points with
percentages, the following assessment category-specific weights will be used:

Four quizzes/in-class assignments (100 points each) 20%

Homework assignment 1 (100 points) 10%

Homework assignment 2 (100 points) 10%

Midterm exam (100 points) 30%

Final exam (100 points) 30%

**Total 100%**

Students should not assume that their overall weighted average points will be
curved in the determination of their final grades. If the instructor decides to
grade on a curve for this course, the choice for the curving methods is entirely
at his discretion.

Students’ final letter grades for the course will be reported based on the
following numerical ranges of weighted average points with percentages: A =
94-100%, A­ = 90-93%, B+ = 87-89%, B = 83-86%, B- = 80-82%, C+ = 77-79%, C =
73-76%, C- = 70-72%, D+ = 67-69%, D = 63-66%, D- = 60-62% and F \<60%. However,
the instructor will have the discretion to make minor changes to the above
cutoffs. Students showing hard work inside and outside the classroom and
exemplary participation in class may be given some positive consideration in the
determination of their final grades. All grades are non-negotiable!

Students in this course must agree to the terms above concerning the
determination of course grades.

**Course Policies:**

-   Lecture handouts will be posted to Blackboard.

-   As per an agreement with SAS® Institute, the instructor will use SAS’
    copyrighted course materials in class. Reproducing the materials by students
    is prohibited by law.

-   Homework assignments submitted after the deadlines will not be accepted for
    grading.

-   The instructor’s response to students’ e-mails with out-of-class questions
    may take up to 24 hours.

-   There will be no make-up exams/tests or extra-credit assignments.

-   Incomplete: A grade of incomplete may only be given to students who are
    *passing* the course and cannot complete the course due to well documented
    circumstances beyond their control.

>   for details.

-   There will be absolutely no tolerance of dishonest conduct during the exams.
    Severe measures will be taken against dishonest conduct. All students must
    be familiar with and abide by the provisions of the ["Code of Academic
    Integrity"](../../Users/Pradip%20Muhuri/SASClassGWU/Syllabus/%22Code%20of%20Academic%20Integrity%22).

>   See <https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity> for details.

-   Students must turn off their mobile devices during class sessions and exams.

**Average Minimum Amount of Out-of-class or Independent Learning Expected Per
Week:**

In a 15-week semester, students are expected to spend 2.5 hours of direct
instruction and a minimum of 5 hours of independent learning (outside of class)
– a total of 7.5 hours per week. See
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I3Q2ckvDi4PPhuPIdHnRV3KGUyFjMNBX1Av16VZIIwk/edit#heading=h.gjdgxs>
for details.

**University Policy on Observance of Religious Holidays:**

In accordance with University policy, students should notify faculty during the
first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their
day(s) of religious observance. See
<https://students.gwu.edu/accommodations-religious-holidays> for details.

​**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities:**

Disability Support Services (DSS): Any student who may need an accommodation
based on the potential impact of a disability should contact the Disability
Support Services office at 202-994-8250 in the Rome Hall, Suite 102, to
establish eligibility and to coordinate reasonable accommodations.
See <https://disabilitysupport.gwu.edu/> for details.

**Mental Health Services 202-994-5300​:**

The University's​ ​Mental Health Services offers 24/7 assistance and referral to
address students' personal, social, career, and study skills problems. Services
for students include: crisis and emergency mental health consultations
confidential assessment, counseling services (individual and small group), and
referrals. See <https://counselingcenter.gwu.edu/> for details.

**Academic Integrity Code:**

Academic dishonesty is defined as cheating of any kind, including
misrepresenting one's own work, taking credit for the work of others without
crediting them and without appropriate authorization, and the fabrication of
information. See: <https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/code-academic-integrity> for
the remainder of the code.

**Security and Safety Policy:**

In the case of an emergency, if possible, the class should shelter in place. If
the building that the class is in is aﬀected, students should follow the
evacuation procedures for the building. After evacuation, they should seek
shelter at a predetermined rendezvous location.

**Obtaining SAS Software:**

The SAS License is available from the Instructional Technology Lab (ITL) free of
charge to GWU students who have registered for this course. The ITL has expanded
its SAS software distribution services. To receive a copy of SAS, students are
required to fill out and submit the online license agreement form
(<http://go.gwu.edu/sasrequestform>). Located in Gelman Library on the lower
level, the ITL is available to assist with SAS installation
problems Monday through Friday during office hours.
