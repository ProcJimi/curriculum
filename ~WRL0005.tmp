SASCourse - GitHub Organization Account
=======================================

This repository is created under a GitHub private account for students in Stat
4197/6197 at the George Washington University. The repository contains sample
programs that are used by the instructor to introduce a wide variety of concepts
and applications of SAS programming language, SQL, macro facility, and SAS/IML.
The programs have been stored in different folders by topic. The sample programs
will supplement weekly handouts that are posted to Blackboard. Students are
encouraged to use these programs as practice exercises to enhance their
comprehension of the materials being discussed in class. The programs were
written by the course instructor or adapted from various sources including SAS®
Documentation, SAS ®conference papers, SAS® Blogs, SAS-L, and sasCommunity.org.
Please let the instructor know of any errors if you have found in the code
snippets posted here. Don't circulate the material.
